This is my first post, how exciting! Hello World has been the traditional first program for computer programmers, and it seems fitting to start my blog with the same tradition. I've been meaning to create a website for a while, but since python is the only programing language that I really know, it's been better to just put it off, but since I'm graduating soon it was cleat that the moment had came. 

I'm interested in learning more about web development, so I thought I'd start with a simple blog. I'm using Jekyll and GitHub pages to host it, so I don't have to worry about hosting or maintaining the site. The site is based on the [Chirpy Jekyll](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/) theme, which seems to be at a good point between being simple and being feature-rich, it also comes with a GitHub action (another thing I need to get around learning) prepared to load the site, which is pretty helpful. 

Technology has always been a good part of my life, I love hardware, PC building, and consumer electronincs in general, but for the past half a decade I've been more interested in the software side of things. I've been learning python for a while now, focusing on data science and machine learning, but I'm also interested in web development, app development, and especially game development. 

The planning for this site is to be a repository of my projects, and a place to share my thoughts on technology and other things. Luckily I've already learn how to do markdown, so I can write posts like this one pretty easily. Let's see how it goes and I hope you enjoy it.


```python
print('Goodbye world')
```
