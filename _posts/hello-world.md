# Hello world

This is my first post, how exciting! I've been meaning to create a website for a while, but given the fact I only really how to program in python, I've been putting it off. I'm interested in learning more about web development, so I thought I'd start with a simple blog. I'm using Jekyll and GitHub pages to host it, so I don't have to worry about hosting or maintaining the site. I'm using the [Chirpy Jekyll](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/) theme, which seems to be at a good point between being simple and being feature-rich, it also comes with a GitHub action (another thing I need to get around learning) prepared to load the site, which is pretty helpful. Thankfully I already know how to write in markdown, so that's one less thing to learn. 

I've always been interested in technology, but for the past half a decade I've been more interested in the software side of things. I've been learning python for a while now, focusing on data science and machine learning, but I'm also interested in web development, app development, and especially game development. I'm hoping to learn more about all of these things, and maybe even start a project or two. I hope this website gives me the motivation to do that, and I hope you enjoy reading it.
