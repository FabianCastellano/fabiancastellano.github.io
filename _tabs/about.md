## So, who are you?

At the current time (and if I'm honest most of the time) that's a difficult question, but I guess I can try to describe myself via some facts, and at the moment of writing (2022-10-23) these are the facts:

- I'm a 24 year old student from Chile
- I'm currently finishing a engineering degree in mathematics (I'm not sure if that's the correct translation, but it's basically a degree in applied mathematics).
- I'm interested in data science, machine learning, web development, app development, and game development.
- I'm good at python, but with a lot more to learn, and I'm planning on javascript and C++ next.
- I'm currently learning how to use GitHub pages and Jekyll to host this website.
- I like to believe I have a good sense of humor, but I'm not sure if that's true.

If you are an employer looking at my website, Hello! I hope I'm giving a good first impression and you like what you see. Given that my CV is only one page long, I'm going to be a little more especific in here. So, I have:

- Experience working with python, particularly on the machine learning and data science side, more specifically:
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - scikit-learn
    - tensorflow
    - keras
    - pytorch   

- Experience working with data science and machine learning, more especifically:
    - Data cleaning
    - Data visualization
    - Data analysis
    - Machine learning

- Experience working with relational databases, more especifically:
    - SQL
    - MySQL
    - PostgreSQL

- Extensive knowledge of the models behind machine learning, and the inner working on the math that supports them, that's the great part of having a degree in mathematics (technically I don't have the degree yet, but I'm finishing it).  
 
- Experience working with git and github.



## So, what's this website?

Being honest, I don't know. I'm hoping it will be a place where I can share my thoughts and ideas, and maybe even start a project or two. I'm not sure if I'll be able to keep it up, but I'm going to try. I'm also hoping it will be a place where I can learn more about web development, and maybe even learn a little bit about web design.
