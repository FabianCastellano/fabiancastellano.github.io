This page is a repository for my past/current proyecs, and a place to share my thoughts on technology, machine learning and other things. It is also fairly new, and a work in progress, so it's not complete yet and it's a bit empty, I'm working on a few projects that I'll be posting here soon, but for now I've make sure this part is ready. 

## So, who are you?

At the current time (and if I'm honest most of the time) that's a difficult question, but I guess I can try to describe myself via some facts, and at the moment of writing (2022-10-23) these are the facts. I am:

- a 24-year-old student from Chile
- currently finishing an engineering degree in mathematics (not sure if that's the correct translation, but it's a degree in applied mathematics).
- weird coffee person. I love coffee and how amazing it can be when done with care and attention to detail.
- interested in data science, machine learning, web development, app development, and game development.
- also interested in hardware, PC building, and consumer electronics in general.
- good at python, but with a lot more to learn. Also planning on javascript and C++ next.
- currently learning how to use GitHub pages and Jekyll to host this website.


If you are an employer looking at my website, Hello! I hope I'm giving a good first impression and you like what you see. You can get my CV [here](https://fabiancastellano.github.io/asstes/files/fabian_castellano_modern_resume.pdf), it's also avaliable in [spanish](https://fabiancastellano.github.io/asstes/files/fabian_castellano_modern_resume_spanish.pdf). Given that my CV is only one page long, I'm going to be a little more specific here. So, I have:

- Experience working with python, particularly on the machine learning and data science side, more specifically:
    - Pandas
    - NumPy
    - MatPlotLib
    - SciKit-Learn
    - Tensorflow
    - Keras
    - PyTorch   

- Experience working with data science and machine learning, more specifically:
    - Data analysis
    - Machine learning
    - Data cleaning
    - Data visualization

- Experience working with relational databases, more specifically:
    - SQL
    - MySQL

- Extensive knowledge of the models behind machine learning, and the inner working of the math that supports them (that's the great part of getting a degree in mathematics).  
 
- Experience working with git and GitHub.

I will be adding more to this list as I go, but I think that's a good start.


## So, what's this website?

To be honest, I don't know. Even though I already wrote that "This page is a repository for my past/current proyecs" I hope it can be a little bit more. I want it to be a place where I can share my thoughts and ideas, save them so they can be a registry of me as a citizen of the internet, and a bit of a time capsule, so that future me can see how I was thinking at the moment and have a few laughs. I hope this is the place I can come back to and see how I was thinking, and how I've changed, and how far I've come.

## Anything else about you?

After giving it some thought, and reading the rest of the post more carefully, I want to point out how important coffee is for me, and the huge part it's played on my life in the past few years. There's a lot to say, and I'm sure if I won't be able to do it justice, but I'm working on a little article that will be posted here when I'm done. But *tl;dr* I love coffee, it's thaught me the value of dedication, caring, and sharing, it also opened my eyes to the world of flavour, and I'm still learning about it. I'm not a coffee expert, but I'm a coffee enthusiast, and I'm always looking to learn more.

And last, I'd love to give a shoutout to my girlfriend, who has been a great support, and has been helping me with basically everything. I love you, and I hope you like this site.
